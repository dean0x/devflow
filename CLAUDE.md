# DevFlow Development Guide

This document contains instructions for developers and AI agents working on the DevFlow codebase. For user documentation, see README.md.

## Purpose for AI Agents

When working on DevFlow code, understand that this toolkit is designed to enhance Claude Code with intelligent development workflows. Your modifications should:

- Maintain brutal honesty in audit outputs
- Preserve context across sessions
- Enhance developer empowerment without replacing judgment
- Ensure all commands are self-documenting

## Architecture Overview

DevFlow consists of four main components:

1. **CLI Tool** (`src/cli/`) - TypeScript-based installer and manager
2. **Claude Code Commands** (`src/claude/commands/`) - Markdown-based slash commands (user-invoked)
3. **Skills** (`src/claude/skills/`) - Auto-activate quality enforcement (model-invoked)
4. **Sub-Agents** (`src/claude/agents/`) - Specialized AI assistants for focused tasks

## Development Environment

### Working on DevFlow

**CRITICAL**: This toolkit is designed for live development. When modifying DevFlow:

1. **Immediately Available** - Changes should be testable in global Claude Code configuration
2. **Instantly Testable** - Work in the devflow repo, test in global context
3. **Continuously Improved** - Dogfood your own tools

### Development Loop

```bash
# 1. Modify command or agent in devflow repo
vim devflow/src/claude/commands/devflow/code-review.md

# 2. Rebuild if CLI changes
npm run build

# 3. Reinstall to global context for testing
node dist/cli.js init

# 4. Test immediately
/code-review

# 5. Iterate until satisfied
# 6. Commit using /commit
```

## Command Design Principles

When creating or modifying commands, follow these principles:

### 1. Brutal Honesty
Commands should expose the truth, not what developers want to hear:
- Security audits find real vulnerabilities
- Performance audits reveal actual bottlenecks
- Architecture audits expose design flaws
- Agent reviews catch AI deception

### 2. Actionable Output
Every audit provides:
- **Specific problems** with file/line references
- **Clear severity** levels (Critical/High/Medium/Low)
- **Concrete fixes** with examples
- **Cost estimates** for remediation

### 3. Context Preservation
Status and review commands create historical records:
- Decisions and rationale
- Problems encountered and solutions
- Evolution of project architecture
- Learning from AI agent interactions

### 4. Fail-Safe Defaults
- Rollback preserves safety branches
- Audits err on the side of flagging issues
- Status tracking captures comprehensive context
- Agent reviews assume skepticism

## Adding New Commands

### Command Structure

1. Create command in `src/claude/commands/devflow/new-command.md`
2. Follow this template:

```markdown
# Command: /new-command

## Description
Brief description of what the command does.

## Usage
`/new-command [arguments]`

## Implementation
[Bash script or instructions for AI agent]

## Output Format
[Description of expected output]
```

3. Test locally before committing
4. Update README.md with user-facing documentation
5. Add to init.ts command list if needed

## Adding New Sub-Agents

### Sub-Agent Structure

1. Create agent in `src/claude/agents/devflow/new-agent.md`
2. Follow existing agent patterns:
   - Clear specialty definition
   - Restricted tool access
   - Focused analysis scope
   - Specific output format

3. Test with explicit invocation
4. Document in README.md for users

## Adding New Skills

### Skill Structure

Skills are **model-invoked** capabilities that auto-activate based on context. They enforce quality without requiring manual invocation.

1. Create skill directory in `src/claude/skills/devflow/skill-name/`
2. Create `SKILL.md` with YAML frontmatter:

```markdown
---
name: skill-name
description: When and why to use this skill (critical for auto-activation)
allowed-tools: Read, Grep, Glob, AskUserQuestion
---

# Skill Name

## Purpose
What this skill enforces and why

## When This Skill Activates
Be specific about trigger conditions

## Pattern Validation Process
Detailed checks and enforcement logic

## Violation Report Format
How to report issues found

## Success Criteria
What passes validation
```

3. Follow existing skill patterns:
   - **Focused enforcement** - One skill, one responsibility
   - **Clear activation triggers** - Specific context patterns
   - **Actionable reports** - File/line references, severity, fixes
   - **Read-only tools** - Most skills should not modify code
   - **Philosophy alignment** - Enforce project principles

4. Test skill activation:
   - Write code that should trigger the skill
   - Verify skill activates automatically
   - Check violation reports are clear
   - Ensure fixes are actionable

5. Document in README.md for users

### Skill vs Command Decision

**Use a Skill when:**
- Should activate automatically based on context
- Enforces patterns/quality (proactive)
- Detects violations during implementation
- Read-only analysis and reporting

**Use a Command when:**
- Requires explicit user decision
- Performs state changes (commits, releases)
- User controls timing (devlog, catch-up)
- Orchestrates complex workflows

**Both (Skill + Command):**
- Common workflow that benefits from both auto and manual modes
- Example: research (auto when unfamiliar, manual when user wants deep dive)

### Current Skills

**Philosophy Enforcers:**
- `pattern-check` - Result types, DI, immutability, pure functions
- `test-design` - Test quality red flags (complex setup, difficult mocking)
- `code-smell` - Fake solutions, unlabeled workarounds, magic values

**Workflow Automation:**
- `research` - Pre-implementation planning and integration strategy
- `debug` - Systematic debugging with hypothesis testing

**Safety Validators:**
- `input-validation` - Boundary validation, SQL injection prevention
- `error-handling` - Result type consistency, exception boundaries

## CLI Development

### Building and Testing

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build TypeScript
npm run build

# Watch mode for development
npm run dev

# Test locally
node dist/cli.js init

# Run specific command
node dist/cli.js uninstall --keep-docs
```

### Release Process

#### 1. Prepare the Release

**Update Version:**
```bash
# Edit package.json version manually (e.g., 0.1.0 -> 0.1.1)
# For patch: increment third digit (bug fixes, docs)
# For minor: increment second digit (new features, backwards compatible)
# For major: increment first digit (breaking changes)
```

**Update CHANGELOG.md:**
```markdown

## Extending DevFlow

### Custom Project Rules
Projects can extend DevFlow by:
1. Adding custom `.docs/` templates
2. Creating project-specific audit rules
3. Extending `.claudeignore` patterns
4. Adding team-specific workflows

### Integration Points
- Git hooks integration
- CI/CD pipeline integration
- Team workflow customization
- Project-specific validations

## Important Implementation Notes

### Git Safety
- Always use `rm -f .git/index.lock &&` before git operations
- Run git commands sequentially, never in parallel
- Preserve user's git configuration
- Never force push without explicit user request

### Token Optimization
- Sub-agents cannot invoke other sub-agents (by design)
- Use parallel execution where possible
- Leverage `.claudeignore` for context reduction
- Keep commands focused and efficient

### Error Handling
- Provide clear error messages
- Suggest fixes for common issues
- Log errors to `.docs/debug/` when appropriate
- Never hide failures from users

## Maintenance Tasks

### Regular Updates
1. Review and update audit patterns
2. Optimize command performance
3. Update dependencies
4. Improve error messages
5. Enhance documentation

### Monitoring Usage
- Track common error patterns
- Identify missing features
- Gather performance metrics
- Review user feedback

## Support for Developers

When working on DevFlow:
1. Review existing command patterns
2. Test changes thoroughly
3. Document all modifications
4. Consider backward compatibility
5. Focus on user value

Remember: The goal is reliable, high-quality development with AI assistance, not blind trust in AI output.
