# React Violations Index

This skill organizes violations by React domain. See the domain-specific files for detailed examples:

## Domain Files

| File | Domain | Key Violations |
|------|--------|----------------|
| [patterns.md](patterns.md) | Core Patterns | Prop drilling, missing keys, direct state mutation |
| [hooks.md](hooks.md) | Hooks | Missing dependencies, conditional hooks, stale closures |
| [forms.md](forms.md) | Forms | Uncontrolled to controlled, missing validation |
| [error-handling.md](error-handling.md) | Error Handling | Missing boundaries, swallowed errors |

## Quick Reference

Each domain file contains both violations (❌) and correct patterns (✅).
