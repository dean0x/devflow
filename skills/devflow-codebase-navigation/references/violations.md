# Codebase Navigation Violations

Common mistakes when exploring unfamiliar codebases:

## Violations

| Violation | Problem | Fix |
|-----------|---------|-----|
| Starting implementation without exploration | Missing existing patterns | Use [commands.md](commands.md) to explore first |
| Ignoring test files | Missing usage examples | Search `*.test.ts` for patterns |
| Not finding entry points | Implementing in wrong location | Find main/index files first |
| Duplicating existing code | Wasted effort, inconsistency | Search for similar functionality |

## Quick Reference

See [patterns.md](patterns.md) for correct exploration patterns and [commands.md](commands.md) for discovery commands.
