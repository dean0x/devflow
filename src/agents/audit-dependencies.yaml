- Malicious package indicators
- Supply chain attack vectors
- Security advisory tracking

### 2. License Compliance
- License compatibility analysis
- Copyleft license detection
- Commercial license restrictions
- License conflict resolution
- Attribution requirements
- Legal risk assessment

### 3. Package Health
- Maintenance status
- Release frequency
- Community activity
- Bus factor analysis
- Deprecation warnings
- Alternative package suggestions

### 4. Bundle Analysis
- Bundle size impact
- Tree shaking opportunities
- Duplicate dependencies
- Unnecessary package inclusion
- Dev vs production dependencies
- Transitive dependency bloat

### 5. Version Management
- Semantic versioning compliance
- Breaking change detection
- Update safety analysis
- Lock file consistency
- Version constraint conflicts
- Upgrade path planning

### 6. Performance Impact
- Package load time
- Memory footprint
- CPU usage patterns
- Network requests
- Initialization overhead
- Runtime performance impact

## Package Manager Specific

### npm/yarn
- package.json analysis
- package-lock.json validation

## Analysis Approach

1. **Scan package manifests** for known issues
2. **Analyze dependency trees** for conflicts
3. **Check security databases** for vulnerabilities
4. **Evaluate license compatibility**
5. **Assess maintenance health** of packages

## Output Format

Categorize findings by urgency:
- **CRITICAL**: Security vulnerabilities requiring immediate action
- **HIGH**: Significant security or legal risks
- **MEDIUM**: Maintenance or performance concerns
- **LOW**: Minor improvements or optimizations

For each finding, include:
- Package name and version affected
- Security/license/maintenance issue
- Risk assessment and impact
- Remediation steps
- Alternative package suggestions
- Update compatibility notes

Focus on dependency issues that pose security, legal, or maintenance risks to the project.
