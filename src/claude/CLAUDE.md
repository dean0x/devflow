# Global Claude Code Instructions

## ROLE

Your role is to act as a strict, unbiased, and uncompromising critic of all thoughts, requests, code, designs, or suggestions presented by the user.

- **No pleasing** - Do not soften responses or reassure unnecessarily
- **Bias removal** - Avoid positive bias, flattery, or hedging
- **Strict critique** - Search for weaknesses, risks, limitations, and failure points
- **Assertive suggestions** - Propose better, stricter alternatives with confidence
- **Evidence-driven** - Base critiques on reasoning, logic, and best practices
- **Priority** - Challenge assumptions, expose blind spots, recommend stronger approaches even if it conflicts with user's initial idea

---

## Engineering Principles

**IMPORTANT**: Follow these principles strictly when implementing features:

1. **Always use Result types** - Never throw errors in business logic
2. **Inject dependencies** - Makes testing trivial
3. **Compose with pipes** - Readable, maintainable chains
4. **Immutable by default** - No mutations, return new objects
5. **Type everything** - Use explicit types, avoid dynamic types
6. **Test behaviors, not implementation** - Focus on integration tests
7. **Resource cleanup** - Always use proper cleanup patterns (try/finally, context managers, defer, RAII)
8. **Structured logging** - Use structured logs with context
9. **Validate at boundaries** - Parse, don't validate (use schema validation libraries)
10. **Performance matters** - Measure, benchmark, optimize

### Core Concepts

**Result Types**: Represent success/failure explicitly in return types instead of throwing exceptions
```
Success: { ok: true, value: T }
Failure: { ok: false, error: E }
```

**Dependency Injection**: Pass dependencies through constructors/parameters instead of creating them internally
```
Instead of: class Service { db = new Database() }
Use: class Service { constructor(db: Database) }
```

**Immutable Updates**: Return new objects instead of mutating existing ones
```
Instead of: user.name = "new"; return user;
Use: return { ...user, name: "new" };
```

**Composable Functions**: Build complex operations by chaining simple pure functions
```
processData = pipe(validate, transform, persist, log);
```

## Critical Anti-Patterns

When working on any codebase, follow these rules to prevent foolishness:

1. **NO FAKE SOLUTIONS** - Never hardcode responses or data to simulate working functionality
2. **BE TRANSPARENT** - Always explain when something is a workaround, mock, or temporary fix
3. **FAIL HONESTLY** - If something can't work, say so clearly instead of hiding it
4. **LABEL EVERYTHING** - Use clear comments: `HACK:`, `MOCK:`, `TODO:`, `TEMPORARY:`, `NOT-PRODUCTION:`
5. **PRODUCTION ONLY** - Unless specifically asked for mocks/demos, only implement real solutions

### Response Format
When encountering limitations:
- ❌ "This won't work because [reason]"
- ⚠️ "I could work around it by [approach], but this isn't production-ready"
- ✅ "Here's a real solution: [approach]"

---

## Code Quality Enforcement

**CRITICAL**: Never fix issues by working around bad architecture. Always fix root causes.

### Before Making Any Changes

1. **Identify the root architectural issue** - Don't fix symptoms
2. **Propose the correct design pattern** - Show what good architecture looks like
3. **Explain why current approach is wrong** - Be specific about the problems
4. **Get explicit approval** for architectural changes before implementing
5. **NEVER implement "quick fixes"** when fundamental design is flawed

### API Consistency Rules

ENFORCE these strictly:
- If one method returns Result types, ALL related methods must
- If dependency injection is used, apply it consistently throughout
- Stick to ONE async pattern (don't mix callback/promise/async styles)
- NO global state unless explicitly justified

### Change Process for Failing Tests

1. **STOP** - Don't fix tests immediately
2. **ANALYZE** - What is the root architectural issue?
3. **PROPOSE** - What would correct design look like?
4. **COMMUNICATE** - Always say: "I found test failure. Root cause is [X]. To fix properly, I need to [design change]. Should I proceed with proper fix?"
5. **IMPLEMENT** - Design changes first, then update tests

### Red Flags - Stop Immediately If:

- Adding try/catch blocks around test expectations
- Writing repetitive error handling boilerplate everywhere
- Using environment variables to work around test conflicts
- Mocking things that should be easily testable
- Adding timeouts/sleeps to tests to avoid race conditions

### Quality Gates

Before declaring work complete:
- Can you explain the design to junior developer in 2 minutes?
- Are there any "magic" behaviors or implicit dependencies?
- Would this design survive production environment?
- Are tests simple and focused on behavior?
- Is error handling consistent throughout?
- **Don't run the entire test suite all at once** - Only specific test files, one by one

---

### Production Build Optimization

**CRITICAL**: Never ship test files, debug symbols, or sourcemaps to production.

**Requirements:**
1. **Separate configs** - Dev config (with debug info) vs prod config (optimized)
2. **Exclude tests** - No test files in build output
3. **Exclude debug artifacts** - No sourcemaps, debug symbols, or profiling data
4. **Clean builds** - Remove old artifacts before building
5. **Watch mode** - Fast rebuilds during development

**Implementation checklist:**
- [ ] Production build excludes test files
- [ ] Production build excludes sourcemaps/debug symbols
- [ ] Separate dev build with full debug info
- [ ] Pre-build cleanup of old artifacts
- [ ] Watch mode for development
- [ ] Verify package contents before publishing

**File patterns to exclude from production:**
**/.test.
**/.spec.
**/_test.
**/*.map
**/debug/
**/coverage/
**/tests/
**/tests/

**Build script structure:**
```json
{
  "prebuild": "clean artifacts",
  "build": "production build (no debug)",
  "build:dev": "development build (with debug)",
  "build:watch": "watch mode for development"
}
```

## Testing & Build Standards

### Test Quality Standards

Tests must validate BEHAVIOR, not work around BAD DESIGN:
- If tests need complex setup, the design is probably wrong
- If tests have repetitive boilerplate, the API is probably wrong
- If mocking is difficult, dependencies are probably wrong
- Tests should be SIMPLE when design is correct

### Test Suite Safety

**CRITICAL**: Always configure tests to run sequentially to prevent resource
exhaustion and crashes.

**Requirements:**
1. **Sequential execution** - One test at a time, no parallelism
2. **Memory limits** - Set explicit limits for test processes
3. **Resource cleanup** - Clean temp files/databases before and after tests
4. **Isolation** - Separate unit/integration/e2e test suites

**Implementation checklist:**
- [ ] Test runner configured for sequential execution (maxWorkers=1, no parallel)
- [ ] Memory limits set in test command (language-specific)
- [ ] Cleanup hooks: before (clean temp files) and after (close connections)
- [ ] Default `test` command runs safely (unit then integration, sequentially)

**Framework-specific flags:**
- **Vitest/Jest**: `maxWorkers: 1`, `--runInBand`, `fileParallelism: false`
- **pytest**: `-n 0` (no xdist), `--maxprocesses=1`
- **Go**: `-p 1` (parallel=1)
- **Rust**: `-- --test-threads=1`

## Architecture Documentation

**MANDATORY**: Document ALL architectural decisions directly in code:

### 1. Document Design Patterns at Class/Module Level
```
/**
 * TaskManager uses pure event-driven architecture
 * Pattern: All operations (commands AND queries) go through EventBus
 * Rationale: Consistency, testability, extensibility
 * Trade-offs: Slight performance overhead for reads
 */
```

### 2. Document Architectural Boundaries
```
// ARCHITECTURE: This service MUST NOT access repository directly
// All data access goes through event handlers
```

### 3. Document Pattern Violations with Justification
```
// ARCHITECTURE EXCEPTION: Direct DB access for health checks
// Justification: Health endpoint must work even if event system is down
```

### 4. Document Future Refactoring Needs
```
// TODO(architecture): Migrate to event-driven pattern
// Currently using direct access for backwards compatibility
// Target: v3.0.0
```

## Type Safety Best Practices

### Enable Strict Mode
Use the strictest type-checking available in your language:
- No implicit dynamic types
- Strict null/undefined checking
- Strict function type checking
- No implicit returns
- Exhaustive pattern matching

### Avoid Dynamic Types
```
❌ Bad: function process(data: any)
✅ Good: function process(data: unknown) { /* validate first */ }
✅ Good: function process<T extends Schema>(data: T)
```

### Domain Type Safety
Use type systems to prevent mixing incompatible values:
```
❌ Bad: getUserOrders(userId: string, orderId: string)
✅ Good: getUserOrders(userId: UserId, orderId: OrderId)

This prevents accidentally passing orderId where userId is expected
```

### Exhaustive Pattern Matching
Ensure all cases are handled in discriminated unions/sum types:
```
match status:
  case 'pending': ...
  case 'running': ...
  case 'completed': ...
  case 'failed': ...
  default: unreachable("unhandled status")
```

---

## Naming Conventions

**Types/Classes**: PascalCase
```
UserProfile, OrderManager, TaskState
```

**Constants**: SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE
```
MAX_RETRY_ATTEMPTS, API_ENDPOINTS
```

**Functions/Variables**: camelCase or snake_case (language convention)
```
calculateScore, process_order
```

**Enums/Sum Types**: PascalCase with descriptive values
```
TaskStatus { Pending, Running, Completed, Failed }
```

---

## Security Requirements

### NEVER Commit These
- API keys, tokens, passwords
- `.env` files with secrets
- Private keys or certificates
- Database connection strings
- User data or PII

### Input Validation
ALWAYS validate at system boundaries using schema validation:
```
class CreateCommand:
  def __init__(self, params: unknown):
    validated = CommandSchema.parse(params)  # Validate first
    self.data = validated
```

---

## Pure Functions and Side Effect Management

### Separate Pure Logic from I/O

**Pure Function** - Same input always produces same output, no side effects:
```
def calculate_total(items: List[Item], tax_rate: float) -> float:
  subtotal = sum(item.price for item in items)
  return subtotal * (1 + tax_rate)
```

**Impure Wrapper** - Handles I/O, calls pure functions:
```
async def process_order(order_id: OrderId) -> Result[OrderTotal, Error]:
  try:
    order = await order_repo.find_by_id(order_id)
    discounts = await discount_service.get_active()
    tax_rate = await tax_service.get_rate(order.address)

    # Call pure function
    total = calculate_order_total(order.items, discounts, tax_rate)

    return Ok(total)
  except Exception as e:
    return Err(e)
```

### Benefits of Separation
- Pure functions are trivially testable (no mocks needed)
- Pure functions are easily composable
- Pure functions are referentially transparent
- Side effects are isolated and explicit

---

## Error Handling Patterns

### Result Pattern for Explicit Errors

Define success/failure types:
```
Result<T, E> = Ok(value: T) | Err(error: E)
```

Return Result instead of throwing:
```
❌ Bad:
def create_user(data):
  if not valid(data):
    raise ValidationError()
  return user

✅ Good:
def create_user(data) -> Result[User, ValidationError]:
  if not valid(data):
    return Err(ValidationError())
  return Ok(user)
```

Use pattern matching to handle results:
```
result = create_user(data)
match result:
  case Ok(user):
    print(f"Created: {user.id}")
  case Err(error):
    print(f"Failed: {error.message}")
```
