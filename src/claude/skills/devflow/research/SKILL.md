# Research Skill

## Purpose

Conduct thorough pre-implementation research to ensure informed decisions:
1. **Analyze approaches** - Evaluate multiple solutions and trade-offs
2. **Study documentation** - Find official patterns and best practices
3. **Review codebase** - Understand existing architecture and conventions
4. **Design integration** - Plan how new code fits existing patterns
5. **Create plan** - Produce actionable implementation roadmap

## When This Skill Activates

Automatically triggers when:
- User requests implementing unfamiliar technology or pattern
- Multiple implementation approaches are possible
- Architectural decisions need to be made
- Integration with existing code requires planning
- Best practices or official patterns need investigation

## Research Process

### Phase 1: Understand the Request

Analyze what's being asked:
- What problem are we solving?
- What technologies/patterns are involved?
- What constraints exist (time, compatibility, architecture)?
- What success criteria define "done"?

### Phase 2: Explore Implementation Approaches

Research multiple solutions:

```bash
# Search for existing implementations in codebase
rg -i "similar_feature|related_pattern" --type ts --type js

# Find existing architectural patterns
find . -name "*.ts" -type f | head -20 | xargs grep -l "class.*Service\|interface.*Repository"

# Check package.json for relevant dependencies
cat package.json | grep -A 50 "dependencies"
```

**Questions to answer:**
- What approaches have been used successfully in this codebase?
- What libraries or frameworks are already available?
- What patterns would be consistent with existing code?
- What are the trade-offs between approaches?

### Phase 3: Study Official Documentation

For external libraries or patterns:

```markdown
## Documentation Research

Use WebFetch to gather:
- Official quick-start guides
- Best practices documentation
- Common patterns and examples
- Integration guides
- Known limitations or gotchas

Focus on:
- How it's meant to be used (official patterns)
- What our specific use case needs
- How to integrate with existing stack
- Security or performance considerations
```

### Phase 4: Analyze Codebase Patterns

Understand existing architecture:

```bash
# Find similar functionality
rg -i "keyword_related_to_feature" --files-with-matches

# Understand file organization
tree -L 3 src/

# Check existing conventions
grep -r "export class.*Service" src/ | head -10
grep -r "export interface.*Repository" src/ | head -10

# Review recent changes in related areas
git log --oneline --since="1 month ago" -- src/relevant/area/ | head -20
```

**Questions to answer:**
- How is similar functionality currently organized?
- What naming conventions are used?
- What design patterns are prevalent?
- What dependencies are typically injected?
- How is error handling done?

### Phase 5: Design Integration Strategy

Plan how new code fits:

```markdown
## Integration Analysis

**File Structure**:
- Where should new files be created?
- What directory structure matches conventions?
- What test files are needed?

**Dependencies**:
- What existing services can be reused?
- What new dependencies need injection?
- How does this fit the dependency graph?

**Error Handling**:
- Does codebase use Result types?
- Are exceptions used at boundaries?
- What error types already exist?

**Testing Strategy**:
- What test patterns are used?
- How are dependencies mocked/injected?
- What test coverage is expected?

**Architecture Alignment**:
- Does this follow existing patterns?
- Are there architectural principles to follow?
- Any documented design decisions to respect?
```

### Phase 6: Produce Implementation Plan

Create actionable roadmap:

```markdown
## Implementation Plan

### Step 1: Setup/Infrastructure
- [ ] Create directory: `src/services/new-feature/`
- [ ] Add types: `src/types/new-feature.ts`
- [ ] Install dependencies: `npm install library-name`

### Step 2: Core Implementation

- [ ] Integration tests: `src/services/new-feature/service.test.ts`
- [ ] Update test fixtures if needed

### Step 5: Documentation
- [ ] Add JSDoc comments
- [ ] Update README if public API
- [ ] Document any architectural decisions

## Research Output Format

Present findings concisely:

```markdown
üî¨ RESEARCH COMPLETE: {Feature/Topic}

## üìä RECOMMENDED APPROACH

**Solution**: {Chosen approach}

**Rationale**:
- Fits existing architecture (example: matches Service pattern in `src/services/`)
- Uses available dependencies (example: leverages existing `database-client`)
- Follows project conventions (example: Result types, dependency injection)

**Trade-offs**:
- ‚úÖ Advantage 1 (example: minimal new dependencies)
- ‚úÖ Advantage 2 (example: testable without mocks)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è  Consideration 1 (example: requires small refactor of X)

## üèóÔ∏è INTEGRATION STRATEGY

**File Structure**:
```
src/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ services/new-feature/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ logic.ts          (pure functions)
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ service.ts        (dependency wrapper)
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ types.ts          (domain types)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ services/new-feature/__tests__/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ logic.test.ts
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ service.test.ts
```

**Dependencies to Inject**:
- `Database` (existing: `src/database/client.ts`)
- `Logger` (existing: `src/utils/logger.ts`)
- `Config` (existing: `src/config/index.ts`)

**Integration Points**:
- Wire in `src/main.ts:67` (following UserService pattern)
- Export from `src/services/index.ts`
- Add to DI container

## üìù IMPLEMENTATION PLAN

### Phase 1: Foundation (1 hour)
- [ ] Create directory structure
- [ ] Define types and interfaces
- [ ] Add to TypeScript paths

### Phase 2: Core Logic (2 hours)
- [ ] Implement pure business functions
- [ ] Add comprehensive JSDoc
- [ ] Write unit tests (should be simple)

### Phase 3: Service Wrapper (1 hour)
- [ ] Create service class with DI
- [ ] Add Result type error handling
- [ ] Wire up to existing services

### Phase 4: Integration Testing (1 hour)
- [ ] Integration tests
- [ ] Verify DI works correctly
- [ ] Test error scenarios

### Phase 5: Finalization (30 min)
- [ ] Documentation review
- [ ] Run full test suite
- [ ] Architecture alignment check

**Total Estimate**: 5.5 hours

Ready to proceed with implementation? This approach:
‚úÖ Aligns with project architecture
‚úÖ Reuses existing patterns
‚úÖ Minimizes new dependencies
‚úÖ Maintains testability
‚úÖ Follows security practices
```

## Integration with Workflow

Research skill coordinates with other skills:

**Before implementation:**
```
User: "Add JWT authentication"
‚Üí research skill activates
‚Üí Studies official JWT libraries
‚Üí Analyzes existing auth patterns
‚Üí Proposes integration strategy
‚Üí Creates implementation plan
‚Üí Waits for approval
```

**Hands off to:**
- **pattern-check**: Ensures implementation follows patterns
- **test-design**: Verifies tests are simple
- **code-smell**: Catches fake solutions
- **input-validation**: Ensures security boundaries

## Research Quality Criteria

Research is complete when:
- ‚úÖ Multiple approaches evaluated with trade-offs
- ‚úÖ Official documentation reviewed
- ‚úÖ Existing codebase patterns understood
- ‚úÖ Integration strategy defined
- ‚úÖ Step-by-step plan created
- ‚úÖ Risks and considerations documented
- ‚úÖ Time estimate provided
- ‚úÖ Key reference files identified

## Example Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Unfamiliar Library
```
User: "Add Redis caching to the API"
‚Üí Research activates
‚Üí Searches codebase for existing caching
‚Üí Finds in-memory cache pattern
‚Üí Researches Redis best practices
‚Üí Plans migration strategy
‚Üí Proposes approach maintaining existing API
```

### Scenario 2: Multiple Approaches
```
User: "Implement real-time notifications"
‚Üí Research activates
‚Üí Evaluates: WebSockets vs SSE vs Polling
‚Üí Analyzes: Current HTTP server setup
‚Üí Considers: Scale requirements, complexity
‚Üí Recommends: SSE (simpler, fits existing stack)
‚Üí Plans: Integration with current services
```

### Scenario 3: Architectural Decision
```
User: "Refactor authentication system"
‚Üí Research activates
‚Üí Reviews: Current auth implementation
‚Üí Identifies: Security issues, tight coupling
‚Üí Studies: Modern auth patterns
‚Üí Proposes: JWT with refresh tokens
‚Üí Plans: Gradual migration path
```

## Success Metrics

Research was valuable if:
- Implementation follows the plan
- No major surprises during implementation
- Existing patterns were reused correctly
- Integration was smooth
- Tests were simple (good design validated)
- No need for major refactoring afterward

## Philosophy Alignment

This skill enforces:
- **Evidence-driven**: Research before implementation
- **No fake solutions**: Understand properly before coding
- **Fix root causes**: Identify architectural issues early
- **Document decisions**: Create record of why approach was chosen

Research prevents rushing into implementation with incomplete understanding.
