## Analysis Approach

1. **Profile execution paths** and identify hot spots
2. **Measure complexity** of critical algorithms
3. **Analyze resource usage** patterns
4. **Benchmark critical operations** where possible
5. **Identify scalability limitations**

## Output Format

Categorize findings by impact:
- **CRITICAL**: Major performance bottlenecks
- **HIGH**: Significant optimization opportunities
- **MEDIUM**: Moderate performance improvements
- **LOW**: Minor optimizations

For each finding, include:
- Specific file and line references
- Performance impact explanation
- Complexity analysis (Big O notation)
- Optimization recommendations
- Implementation examples
- Measurement suggestions

Focus on performance issues that will have measurable impact on user experience or system scalability.
