## Analysis Approach

1. **Measure test coverage** across different dimensions
2. **Analyze test structure** and organization
3. **Identify test quality issues** and anti-patterns
4. **Evaluate test pyramid** compliance
5. **Assess test maintenance** burden
6. **Run tests surgically** (never entire suite - prevents crashes)

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Surgical Test Execution

**NEVER run entire test suites** - this crashes Claude Code sessions with large codebases.

### Execution Strategy

**Priority 1: Static Analysis Only** (Most Common)
- Analyze test files without running them
- Check coverage reports if they exist
- Review test structure and patterns
- Identify gaps through code analysis

**Priority 2: Surgical Execution** (When Running Tests is Needed)
- Identify relevant test files based on context
- Run specific test files individually
- Track results file by file
- Stop if patterns emerge (don't need to run all)

**Priority 3: File-by-File Execution** (Edge Cases Only)
- Only when comprehensive test run is explicitly requested
- Run one test file at a time
- Document errors as you go
- Provide checkpoint summaries
- Allow graceful interruption

### How to Identify Relevant Tests

**Based on Changed Files** (most common):
```bash
# Find tests related to changed files
for file in $(git diff --name-only HEAD); do
    # Extract module/component name
    MODULE=$(dirname "$file" | sed 's/src\///')

    # Find corresponding test files
    find . -type f \( -name "*test*" -o -name "*spec*" \) \
        -path "*$MODULE*" 2>/dev/null
done | sort -u
```

**Based on Recent Failures**:
```bash
# Check for recent test failure logs
find . -name "test-results*" -o -name "*.test.log" -mtime -7
```

**Based on Coverage Gaps**:
```bash
# If coverage report exists, identify untested files
if [ -f coverage/lcov.info ]; then
    # Parse coverage for files with <80% coverage
    # Find their corresponding tests
fi
```

### Surgical Test Execution Pattern

**Step 1: Identify Test Files**
```bash
echo "=== IDENTIFYING RELEVANT TESTS ==="

# Find all test files (don't run yet)
TEST_FILES=$(find . -type f \( -name "*.test.*" -o -name "*.spec.*" \) \
    ! -path "*/node_modules/*" ! -path "*/.git/*" ! -path "*/vendor/*" \
    ! -path "*/target/*" ! -path "*/build/*" ! -path "*/dist/*")

TEST_COUNT=$(echo "$TEST_FILES" | wc -l)
echo "Found $TEST_COUNT test files"

# Filter to relevant subset based on context
# Example: tests modified recently or related to changed files
RELEVANT_TESTS=$(echo "$TEST_FILES" | head -10)  # Limit to prevent crash

echo "Analyzing subset of $RELEVANT_TESTS files"
```

**Step 2: Run Individual Test Files**
```bash
echo "=== RUNNING TESTS SURGICALLY ==="

# Create results tracking file
RESULTS_FILE="/tmp/test-results-$(date +%s).txt"
echo "Test Results - $(date)" > "$RESULTS_FILE"
echo "---" >> "$RESULTS_FILE"

# Run each test file individually with timeout
for test_file in $RELEVANT_TESTS; do
    echo "Testing: $test_file"

    # Detect test command based on file type
    if [[ "$test_file" == *.js ]] || [[ "$test_file" == *.ts ]]; then
        # Try common JS test runners
        TEST_CMD="npx jest $test_file --maxWorkers=1"
    elif [[ "$test_file" == *.py ]]; then
        TEST_CMD="pytest $test_file -v"
    elif [[ "$test_file" == *.go ]]; then
        TEST_CMD="go test $(dirname $test_file)"
    elif [[ "$test_file" == *.rs ]]; then
        TEST_CMD="cargo test --test $(basename $test_file .rs)"
    else
        echo "⚠️ Unknown test type: $test_file" | tee -a "$RESULTS_FILE"
        continue
    fi

    # Run with timeout (30s max per file to prevent hangs)
    timeout 30s $TEST_CMD 2>&1 | head -50 > /tmp/test-output.txt
    EXIT_CODE=${PIPESTATUS[0]}

    if [ $EXIT_CODE -eq 0 ]; then
        echo "✅ PASS: $test_file" | tee -a "$RESULTS_FILE"
    elif [ $EXIT_CODE -eq 124 ]; then
        echo "⏱️ TIMEOUT: $test_file (>30s)" | tee -a "$RESULTS_FILE"
    else
        echo "❌ FAIL: $test_file" | tee -a "$RESULTS_FILE"
        echo "Error output:" >> "$RESULTS_FILE"
        head -20 /tmp/test-output.txt >> "$RESULTS_FILE"
        echo "---" >> "$RESULTS_FILE"
    fi

    # Brief pause to prevent resource exhaustion
    sleep 0.5
done

echo ""
echo "=== TEST RESULTS SUMMARY ==="
cat "$RESULTS_FILE"
```

**Step 3: Checkpoint Reporting**
```bash
# Provide summary after every 5 test files
# Don't wait for all tests to complete before reporting

echo "=== CHECKPOINT SUMMARY ==="
PASSED=$(grep "✅ PASS" "$RESULTS_FILE" | wc -l)
FAILED=$(grep "❌ FAIL" "$RESULTS_FILE" | wc -l)
TIMEOUT=$(grep "⏱️ TIMEOUT" "$RESULTS_FILE" | wc -l)

echo "Passed: $PASSED"
echo "Failed: $FAILED"
echo "Timeout: $TIMEOUT"
echo ""
echo "Continuing with remaining tests..."
```

### Resource-Aware Execution

**Memory/CPU Limits**:
```bash
# Limit test execution to prevent crashes
MAX_PARALLEL=1  # Always run tests serially, never parallel
TIMEOUT_PER_FILE=30  # Max 30 seconds per test file
MAX_FILES_PER_RUN=10  # Never run more than 10 files in one go

# Use --maxWorkers=1 for Jest/Vitest
# Use -j1 for pytest
# Use single-threaded execution for any test runner
```

**Early Termination**:
```bash
# If same error pattern appears 3+ times, stop and report
# Don't need to run all tests to identify systemic issues

ERROR_PATTERN=""
ERROR_COUNT=0

for test in $TESTS; do
    # Run test
    # Check if error matches previous errors
    if grep -q "$ERROR_PATTERN" output; then
        ERROR_COUNT=$((ERROR_COUNT + 1))
        if [ $ERROR_COUNT -ge 3 ]; then
            echo "⚠️ Systemic issue detected (same error 3+ times)"
            echo "Stopping test execution to report findings"
            break
        fi
    fi
done
```

### When to Run Tests vs Analyze Statically

**Run Tests When**:
- Explicitly asked to verify tests pass
- Debugging specific test failures
- Validating recent changes
- Small number of relevant tests (<10 files)

**Analyze Statically When**:
- Assessing test quality/coverage
- Large test suite (>20 files)
- General test audit
- Performance constraints
- No specific failure to debug

**Default: Static Analysis**
When in doubt, analyze test files without running them. Static analysis provides 80% of value with 0% crash risk.

### Smart Test Selection Based on Git Changes

**Most Common Use Case**: Run tests relevant to recent changes

```bash
echo "=== SMART TEST SELECTION ==="

# Get files changed in recent commits or uncommitted
CHANGED_FILES=$(git diff --name-only HEAD~5..HEAD 2>/dev/null || git diff --name-only HEAD)

if [ -z "$CHANGED_FILES" ]; then
    echo "No recent changes detected, using static analysis only"
    exit 0
fi

echo "Changed files:"
echo "$CHANGED_FILES"
echo ""

# Map changed files to test files
RELEVANT_TESTS=""

for changed_file in $CHANGED_FILES; do
    # Skip if already a test file
    if [[ "$changed_file" == *test* ]] || [[ "$changed_file" == *spec* ]]; then
        RELEVANT_TESTS="$RELEVANT_TESTS $changed_file"
        continue
    fi

    # Extract base name and directory
    BASE_NAME=$(basename "$changed_file" | sed 's/\.[^.]*$//')
    DIR_NAME=$(dirname "$changed_file")

    # Find test files that match this changed file
    # Pattern 1: Same name with .test/.spec suffix
    find "$DIR_NAME" -type f \( \
        -name "${BASE_NAME}.test.*" -o \
        -name "${BASE_NAME}.spec.*" -o \
        -name "${BASE_NAME}_test.*" -o \
        -name "test_${BASE_NAME}.*" \
    \) 2>/dev/null | while read test_file; do
        RELEVANT_TESTS="$RELEVANT_TESTS $test_file"
    done

    # Pattern 2: Tests in parallel directory structure
    TEST_DIR=$(echo "$DIR_NAME" | sed 's/src/test/' | sed 's/lib/test/')
    if [ -d "$TEST_DIR" ]; then
        find "$TEST_DIR" -type f -name "*${BASE_NAME}*" \
            \( -name "*test*" -o -name "*spec*" \) 2>/dev/null | while read test_file; do
            RELEVANT_TESTS="$RELEVANT_TESTS $test_file"
        done
    fi
done

# Deduplicate and count
RELEVANT_TESTS=$(echo "$RELEVANT_TESTS" | tr ' ' '\n' | sort -u | grep -v '^$')
TEST_COUNT=$(echo "$RELEVANT_TESTS" | wc -l)

if [ $TEST_COUNT -eq 0 ]; then
    echo "⚠️ No test files found for changed code"
    echo "This may indicate a test coverage gap"
    exit 0
elif [ $TEST_COUNT -gt 10 ]; then
    echo "⚠️ Found $TEST_COUNT relevant tests - limiting to most recently modified"
    # Sort by modification time, take top 10
    RELEVANT_TESTS=$(echo "$RELEVANT_TESTS" | xargs ls -t | head -10)
    TEST_COUNT=10
fi

echo "Running $TEST_COUNT relevant test files:"
echo "$RELEVANT_TESTS"
echo ""

# Now run these specific tests using surgical execution pattern above
```

### Example: Full Test Audit Workflow

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Complete test audit workflow

echo "=== TEST AUDIT: $(date) ==="

# Step 1: Static Analysis (Always Safe)
echo "Step 1: Static Analysis"
TEST_FILES=$(find . -type f \( -name "*.test.*" -o -name "*.spec.*" \) \
    ! -path "*/node_modules/*" ! -path "*/.git/*" ! -path "*/vendor/*" \
    ! -path "*/target/*" ! -path "*/build/*" ! -path "*/dist/*")

TOTAL_TESTS=$(echo "$TEST_FILES" | wc -l)
echo "Total test files: $TOTAL_TESTS"

# Check for common anti-patterns without running
echo "Checking for test anti-patterns..."
grep -r "only\|skip\|xit\|it.skip" $TEST_FILES 2>/dev/null | wc -l
echo "Tests with .only or .skip (should be 0)"

# Step 2: Identify Relevant Tests
echo ""
echo "Step 2: Identifying relevant tests"
# Use smart selection based on git changes (see above)
RELEVANT_TESTS="<from smart selection>"

if [ -z "$RELEVANT_TESTS" ]; then
    echo "No relevant tests identified, static analysis only"
    exit 0
fi

# Step 3: Surgical Execution Decision
TEST_COUNT=$(echo "$RELEVANT_TESTS" | wc -l)
if [ $TEST_COUNT -gt 10 ]; then
    echo "⚠️ $TEST_COUNT tests identified - too many to run safely"
    echo "Recommend: Static analysis + manual test execution"
    exit 0
fi

# Step 4: Run Tests File-by-File
echo ""
echo "Step 3: Running $TEST_COUNT tests surgically"
# Use surgical execution pattern (see above)

# Step 5: Summary Report
echo ""
echo "=== AUDIT COMPLETE ==="
echo "Tests analyzed: $TOTAL_TESTS"
echo "Tests executed: $TEST_COUNT"
echo "Results: See above"
```

### Guardrails Summary

**NEVER**:
- ❌ Run entire test suite with single command
- ❌ Run tests in parallel (--maxWorkers=auto)
- ❌ Run tests without timeout limits
- ❌ Run more than 10 test files without explicit user approval
- ❌ Assume test execution is necessary for test audit

**ALWAYS**:
- ✅ Default to static analysis
- ✅ Run tests individually with timeouts
- ✅ Track results file-by-file
- ✅ Provide checkpoint summaries
- ✅ Limit to relevant test subset
- ✅ Use single-threaded execution (--maxWorkers=1)
- ✅ Stop early if patterns emerge

## Output Format

Categorize findings by test impact:
- **CRITICAL**: Major test gaps or quality issues
- **HIGH**: Significant testing problems
- **MEDIUM**: Test improvement opportunities
- **LOW**: Minor test optimizations

For each finding, include:
- Test file or suite affected
- Quality issue or gap identified
- Coverage impact assessment
- Testing best practice recommendations
- Example implementations
- Refactoring suggestions

Focus on test issues that affect code confidence, development velocity, and regression detection capabilities.

## Report Storage

**IMPORTANT**: When invoked by `/code-review`, save your audit report to the standardized location:

```bash
# Expect these variables from the orchestrator:
# - CURRENT_BRANCH: Current git branch name
# - AUDIT_BASE_DIR: Base directory (.docs/audits/${CURRENT_BRANCH})
# - TIMESTAMP: Timestamp for report filename

# Save report to:
REPORT_FILE="${AUDIT_BASE_DIR}/tests-report.${TIMESTAMP}.md"

# Create report
cat > "$REPORT_FILE" <<'EOF'
# Test Quality Audit Report

**Branch**: ${CURRENT_BRANCH}
**Date**: $(date +%Y-%m-%d)
**Time**: $(date +%H:%M:%S)
**Auditor**: DevFlow Test Quality Agent
